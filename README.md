# ZeroVM

ZeroVM is the best thing ever.

ZeroVM is a simple virtual machine.
ZeroVM can run (and isolate) 64-bit x86 applications in a 32-bit address space.
ZeroVM works under Linux x86_64.
For more information check out [ZeroVM.org](http://zerovm.org)

## Installation:

Everything has been tested on Ubuntu 10.04 and Ubuntu 12.04. No issues with VMWare Player.
VirtualBox [doesn't support SSE4.1](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/8651), which is used by several of the provided samples.

## Installing ZeroVM

### To install ZeroVM build environment see toolchain installation guide: [toolchain] (https://github.com/zerovm/toolchain/blob/master/README.md)

Proceeed only after checking the link above.

### Eclipse CDT installation
   1. If your system doesn't have JRE, install a recent JRE.
   2. Download Eclipse CDT from the [Eclipse download site][eclipse-dl]. No installation necessary, just unpack and run executable.
   3. Download and install [EGit plugin][egit-plugin] for Eclipse
   4. Point EGit to `git://github.com/zerovm/zerovm.git` and pull the most recent ZeroVM sources.
   5. Select 'create C/C++ project from makefile" to create a new Eclipse project.
   6. Run the makefile to build the project and run unit tests.

   If everything is ok you will see output of the unit tests. Now if you've got `RUN OK PASSED` messages, you have successfully compiled ZeroVM for your platform! You'll find the `zerovm` executable in the project root directory.
